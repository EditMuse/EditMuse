## 💰 Revenue Optimization (Without Hurting Value)

### 1. **Smart Upsell Strategy**

- **Implementation**: 
  - Track credit usage in real-time
  - Show in-app banner: "You've used 240/300 credits. Upgrade to Growth for 1,000 credits"
  - Link directly to upgrade flow
- **Impact**: Increase ARPU by 20-30%
- **Value**: Helps merchants before they hit limits

- **Value**: Merchants see what they're missing

#### C. Annual Plans (Discount)

  - Show savings prominently
  - Better cash flow upfront
- **Impact**: 
  - Increase revenue 10-15% (reduced churn + upfront cash)

### 3. **Optimize Pricing Tiers** (Subtle Adjustments)

#### A. Improve Plan Positioning
**Current**:

- **Value**: Better step-up option, more revenue from mid-tier merchants
- **Impact**: Capture merchants who find GROWTH too small but SCALE too expensive

#### B. Credit Pricing Optimization
- **Current**: Overage rates vary by plan (good)
